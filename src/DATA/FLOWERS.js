Hyacinths represent tenderness, joy and rebirth. They are especially popular in Europe, where they are called "rain flowers" and are breeding many varieties, the most famous of which is the oriental hyacinth. Large inflorescences, bright colors and amazing aroma make hyacinths the favorite flowers of many florists when making colorful bouquets and lush arrangements. These truly beautiful flowers are also good because they do not have categorical or conflicting interpretations, therefore they are considered universal. Hyacinths will organically complement any flower arrangement, and in the form of a mono-bouquet they will be beautiful on their own. Whether it\'s a birthday, an anniversary, a festive date, a solemn event or even the absence of any reason, a bouquet of hyacinths will always be a pleasant surprise and a welcome sign of attention. Hyacinths become especially relevant in the spring, when they are given to beloved women to awaken romantic feelings along with the awakening of nature itself.'

Since then, it has become customary to call St. John\'s wort its dosage forms, and those used in floristry - exclusively hypericum. Today, hypericum is rightfully considered a universal addition, suitable for many flower arrangements. The bright flowers of this plant are yellow or orange in color, however, for making bouquets, stems with unopened buds or formed green and red berries are most often used, perfectly in harmony with dense rich green leaves. Hypericum is capable of giving the finished finishing touch to compositions of a wide variety of flowers and can be included in bouquets of any style from classic and moderately conservative to innovatively bold and even avant-garde. In addition, lush arrangements with this plant often become a successful interior decoration at festive and festive events.'

In the language of flowers, gypsophila symbolizes purity of thoughts, sincerity of intentions and a wish for happiness. Turning into a dried flower, it is widely used in the art of ikebana, in the context of which each flower acquires its own unique connotation and, as part of a bouquet, has a clear or deeply philosophical meaning. In modern floristry, gypsophila is most often used as an elegant addition to bouquets of bright flowering plants, to which it gives even greater tenderness, airiness and volume. By itself, this flower is quite versatile, so compositions with it can be presented to women, men, parents, children, colleagues and friends on any festive or solemn occasion, and also without any reason as a pleasant surprise. In the cut, gypsophila is characterized by high stability and unpretentiousness, therefore it is often found in compositions of other resistant flowers.'

In the language of flowers, the gladiolus symbolizes courage, nobility, valor and honor, as well as friendship, fidelity, respect and love. Despite the fact that it has been considered a male flower since ancient times, many of the fair sex often like to accept it as a gift. And, of course, in our country it is difficult to imagine the celebration of Knowledge Day at the beginning of the school year without smart schoolchildren and their teachers with bouquets of these traditional flowers. In addition, gladioli are often presented to couples on significant anniversaries and anniversaries of their wedding. It is rather difficult to find suitable partners in composition for these majestic and self-sufficient flowers, therefore gladioli are most often presented in the form of a mono-bouquet decorated with a sprig of fern, asparagus or other decorative greenery.'

In the latter case, these flowers should be given if you are unshakable in your intentions, and your chosen one knows exactly this meaning of the bouquet. In some cultures, hydrangea is believed to ward off illness and misfortune. Sometimes even more magical properties are attributed to her and are actively used in various rituals. When choosing bouquets, many buyers are accustomed to not paying close attention to hydrangeas, and florists have learned to skillfully turn this fact to their advantage: their unrestricted imagination and high skill create compositions with hydrangeas so bewitching that they are able not only to draw attention to themselves, but and persuade you in favor of buying such a non-trivial and very original bouquet.'

The dried flowers of this beautiful plant are often used in the preparation of dry bouquets.

In different cultures, irises have different meanings: in ancient Egypt, this flower was a symbol of eloquence, in Babylon it personified the power of royal power, and in Japan it is still held in special esteem. The Japanese traditionally associate it with courage, so iris flowers are used to make mascots for young sons on Boys\' Day. In Slavic cultures, the iris flower has a different meaning and traditionally symbolizes purity and purity. Outwardly, irises vaguely resemble orchids, and their color variety goes far beyond the basic shades of the rainbow. Irises are straight and proud flowers, therefore, in modern floristry they are considered universal: bouquets with them can be presented to a young girl, a mature woman, a colleague, a boy, and even an adult man. And if, at the same time, the meaning of these colors, traditional for Japan, is correctly presented, then the delight of any of the representatives of the stronger sex will be guaranteed.'

        Description: 'Limonium, aka statica and kermek, is a genus of perennial flowering plants of the pigweed family, which includes about 300 species. In the wild form, these flowers can be found practically all over the world, but the Canary Islands are considered their homeland. Despite the obvious associations, this plant has nothing in common with the well-known lemon, and its name comes from a Greek word that means meadow or lawn, and it obviously got such a name because of its habitual place of growth. Limonium flowers, as a rule, have a violet or purple shade, but quite often there are flowers of pink, blue, and even yellow tones. Being quite miniature, they are collected in panicle-shaped inflorescences. In floristry, limonium has gained popularity relatively recently, and since then it has been actively cultivated not only as a garden crop, but also as a cutting. Usually ego is used as an additional element to give the finishing touches to various bouquets, as well as, for example, gypsophila. After a sufficiently long period of preservation of freshness in cutting conditions, limonium gradually turns into an aesthetically attractive dried flower that perfectly preserves its shape and appearance.'

        Description: 'Lunaria, or moonflower, is a genus of herbaceous plants of the cruciferous family with large flowers of purple, lilac, violet or white tones, collected in panicle inflorescences. However, this plant is notable primarily not for its flowers, but for its unusual and easily recognizable fruit pods, similar in shape to the celestial disk of our natural satellite, which is why it got its name. Lunaria plantings are mainly used for the purposes of landscape, home and decorative garden landscaping, since its non-trivial appearance and general unpretentiousness are perfectly suited to solving such tasks. In floristry, plants with blooming flowers or ripe fruits are not used so often, so bouquets with them always look extremely original and very fresh. Alternative popular names of lunaria are "coin tree" and "silver ruble", so its decorative fruits-coins in bouquets and compositions symbolize material abundance and financial well-being. Then the dried stalks of lunaria with ripened fruits gradually turn into an equally attractive and sufficiently resistant dried flower, suitable for assembling a variety of interior compositions.'
